     The door that finally opens
     With light flooding in
     Spilling out on the floor

     The core that never was
     Now it will be
     The bones of
     What was there before

     Every step, every beat
     Every thought, every breath
     Everything is longing

     Every wind, every wave
     Every sky, every cloud
     Every grave is longing

     Every step, every beat
     Every thought, every breath
     Everything is longing

     Every wind, every wave
     Every sky, every cloud
     Every grave is longing

     Pulling you from the sky
     Just like love will do.
